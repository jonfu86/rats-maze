# The Rat's Maze - https://jonfu86.github.io/rats-maze/

## Info
I built this application as an exercise in visualization of an algorithm problem known as "The Rat's Maze". Essentially we are tasked with finding out if a given maze as defined by a given 2d matrix is solvable. In this problem, "1"s represent obstructions and "0"s represent an open space. We are given a start and end point and must discover if there is a clear path between them. Feel free to check out my other projects at <a href="https://www.github.com/jonfu86">Github</a> or find out more about me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonfu">LinkedIn</a>.
 
## Warning
This maze solver will return every possible route without backtracking regardless of how many steps or how inefficient the path. Please design your maze so that it actually represents a maze, with limited paths to reach the end point otherwise risk crashing your browser.
